// built and already carrying their middleware, plus the things a handler needs
// to construct itself.
//
// The groups are the same variables routes.go uses, so a route registered here
// is indistinguishable from one written inline. Public is outside the auth
// middleware and behind an API key; Protected takes a JWT or an API key; Admin
// additionally requires the ADMIN role.

// it by name.

// Go runs init() functions in a file-name order fixed by the compiler, so the
// registration order is deterministic. It does not matter in practice: Gin
// routes on a tree, not a list, and prefers a static segment over a parameter
// however the two were added.

//
// Two orders for the last item both read Stock = 1, both find it sufficient,
// and both write 0. One unit, two sales, and the row does not even look
// strange afterwards. The window is the few milliseconds between the read and
// the write, which is exactly when a checkout is busiest.
//
// The fix is not a mutex, and not a longer transaction. It is to stop reading
// the value at all:
//
//	UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ? AND stock >= 1
//
// The database evaluates the condition and applies the change as one
// statement, so the second order updates zero rows and is told so. There is no
// window because there is no gap between deciding and doing.

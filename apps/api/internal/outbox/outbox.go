// Package outbox makes "save the row and tell the world" a single atomic act.
//
// The problem it solves has two halves, and doing the obvious thing gets one
// of them wrong whichever order you pick.
//
// Publish first, then commit: the publish succeeds, the commit fails, and a
// webhook has now announced an order that does not exist. Downstream systems
// act on it. There is nothing to reconcile against, because the row was never
// written.
//
// Commit first, then publish: the commit succeeds, the process is killed
// before the publish, and the order exists with nobody told. No error is
// logged anywhere, because from the process's point of view nothing failed.
//
// The outbox removes the choice. The message is written to a table in the same
// transaction as the business data, so it commits or rolls back with it, and a
// relay reads committed messages and delivers them afterwards. Either both
// happened or neither did.
//
// The cost is delivery semantics: at-least-once, not exactly-once. A message
// can be delivered twice if the process dies between the send and the status
// update. Consumers have to be idempotent, which is what a dedup key on the
// receiving end is for.
